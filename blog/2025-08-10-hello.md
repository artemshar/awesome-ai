Hello! How are you doing?

My name is Artem Shar. Like many others, I am overwhelmed by the rapid development of the IT industry in recent years, particularly the boom in LLMs (AI hype). I'm working on this project purely out of enthusiasm. I'm doing it partly to cope with FOMO (fear of missing out) to keep up with the new shift in the industry. But also doing this project to help myself (as a software engineer) and other people don't worry, and just considering and try new good tools in our work. 

I'm sure we'll get through this shifting, and just do more human, interesting things and everything will be fine! ðŸ™Œ
